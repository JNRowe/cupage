title: Make a verbose matcher for awkward downloads.
desc: |-
  Some upstreams make awkwardly named downloads, and there should be an
  option to check them too.  An example to hand would be pydelicious_,
  that makes releases such as:
  
      * pydelicious+tools-0.5.3.zip 
  
  .. _pydelicious: http://code.google.com/p/pydelicious/
type: :feature
component: cupage
