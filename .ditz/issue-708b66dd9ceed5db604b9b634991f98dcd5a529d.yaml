title: Provide a way to override updates text.
desc: |-
  Some output is quite difficult to read and check, for example vim-script matches
  will display "download_script.php?src_id=11920" which is a direct link to the
  rail plugin v4.1.  It would be nice to be able to change the output for some
  sites instead of just displaying the textual match.
