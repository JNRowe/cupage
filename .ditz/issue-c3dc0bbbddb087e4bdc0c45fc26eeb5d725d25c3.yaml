title: Consider using the "Versions" link for hackage.
desc: |-
  This would then report *all* available versions instead of the just most
  current.  The change would make the hackage matcher work the same as most of the
  other site matchers(the exception being pypi).

    Unfortunately, this isn't as simple as it looks.  The current version isn't
    wrapped in a link which means it wouldn't get displayed.
    
    Either this stays as it is, or support for defining the "getter" needs to be
    added, this may actually be useful for other purposes too.
