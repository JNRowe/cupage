title: Added a option to limit the frequency of checks.
desc: |-
  It would be nice if one could change the frequency sites are checked, for
  example if a site is known to only cut releases once a month there is no point
  checking daily.
  
  Something like:
  
      [entry1]
      url = example.com/url1
      frequency = 1m
      [entry2]
      url = example.com/url2
      frequency = 3w

    Along with a new --force option to ignore frequency checks, which will be useful
    when testing site responses.
