Currently the tar and zip matchers will match on any string for the package
prefix, this needs to be tightened so that pages that list more than one
project can easily be checked.  An example would be my UKFSN downloads list
output::

    upoints has new matches:
        bfm-0.6.0.tar.bz2
        bfm-0.6.1.tar.bz2
        bfm-0.6.2.tar.bz2
        bfm-0.6.3.tar.bz2
        bfm-0.6.4.tar.bz2
        distance-0.10.0.tar.bz2
        distance-0.2.1.tar.bz2
